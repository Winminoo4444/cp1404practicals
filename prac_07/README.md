## Brief Information About The Repo And Myself 
I am Win Min Oo.
I am Bachelor of Information Technology Student in James Cook University, Singapore. 
The repo is a fundamental element of GitHub, which is a place for storing codes, files and version history of each file.  

## 3 Main Lessons I have learned About "Clean Code" in this subject
- Avoid duplication: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Show its intention: Docstring comments for functions
- Follow best practice: Avoid Magic Number and Declare Constant instead
