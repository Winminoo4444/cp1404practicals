# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were often overly optimistic. I would underestimate how long it would take to debug or fully implement a task.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became better at estimating by factoring in potential delays, like debugging and testing. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of understanding the scope of a problem before estimating.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to view my code from a different perspective, as reviewers often catch issues or inefficiencies I overlooked

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By reviewing others people's code, I improved my ability to spot issues like unclear logic and poor formatting, which in turn helped me write better code myself for assignments and future practical tasks.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review I did for the user LachlanMagill](https://github.com/LachlanMagill/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

I carefully reviewed the code, highlighted key issues, and provided actionable feedback to improve its functionality and readability.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review I did for the user Dajin-01](https://github.com/Dajin-01/cp1404practicals-/pull/1#event-14745958458)

### Explanation

I thoroughly analyzed the user's code, offering constructive suggestions to enhance its efficiency and maintainability.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add clearer and shorter instructions for the practicals, also including demo videos for difficult ones.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I was able to made pretty good attempt on all practicals.
